# 🧠 RNN Embedding-based Text Classification

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model for **text classification**, using word embeddings to capture semantic relationships. The goal is to classify text data into predefined categories based on the sequence and context of words.

## 🧪 Key Features

- 🔤 **Word Embedding Layer**: Uses `Embedding` layer to convert tokens into dense vectors.
- 🔁 **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Processes sequences to understand contextual relationships.
- 🧾 **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding, and vocabulary creation using `Keras` utilities.
- 📊 **Classification Output**: Predicts class labels for given textual inputs.
